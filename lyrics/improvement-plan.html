		<title>Lyrics Improvement Plan</title>
	<body>
		My original mockup was modeled after the music video for On the Regular. I wasn't satisfied with it, so I completely changed my concept to be based after the album art instead. Pretty much the only thing I kept was the typeface Reenie Beanie for the title. My partners were Jane, Mimi, and Marina.

		Changes:
			<ul>
				<li>changed from portrait to landscape orientation</li>
				<li>changed organization </li>
				<li>added grid</li>
				<li>changed main image from a still from the music video to the "Ratchet" album art</li>
				<li>changed background color from white to almost-black to blend in with the album art</li>
				<li>changed the body type color from black with green and red accents to white with purple and light green accents (eyedropped from the album art)</li>
				<li>changed the body typeface from Roboto Condensed to Avenir</li>
				<li>added white squiggles</li>
				<li>added a play/pause button/audio player</li>
			</ul>
