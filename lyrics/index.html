<br>Hi, hi, howdy, howdy, hi, hi!
<br>While everyone is minus, you could call me multiply
<br>Just so you know, yes, yes, I'm that guy
<br>You could get five fingers and I'm not waving "hi"
<br>Guess I'm never-ending, you could call me pi
<br>But really, how long till the world realize?
<br>Yes, yes I'm the best, fuck what you heard
<br>Anything less is <em>(obviously absurd)</em>

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Bridge]</font><br>
Haters get the bird, more like an eagle
<br>This is my movie, stay tuned for the sequel
<br>Seems so wrong, seems so illegal
<br>Fellas in the back like a foul-ball free-throw

<br><br>
<font color="#695794">[Chorus]</font>
<br><font color="#bbd8a4">Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know</font>

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Verse 2]</font>
<br>I come with the tip, with the blow, with the boom
<br>And if you're in my way, there's nothing but doom
<br>Ain't got no time for you ratchet-ass goons
<br>And just settle down, listen to my tunes
<br>Ever since I was eight I was attached to the mic
<br>Wanted a guitar before I wanted a bike
<br>Had an Epiphone, fuck a Fisher-Price
<br>Never see the sun cause I'm up all night <em>(what?)</em>

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Verse 3]</font>
<br>Really, really? Really, really?
<br>You want to talk shit but you know that I am illy?
<br>Illy to the fullest, you can call me cancer
<br>No multiple choice, cause I'm the only answer
<br>Ain't got no wallet, only use rubber bands
<br>You know my chick is ratchet cause that's what make her dance
<br>You wanna get at me, but you don't stand a chance
<br>And if you wanna fuck, yes you can

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Chorus]</font>
<br><font color="#bbd8a4">Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>Yep, yep, you know that I go

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Verse 4]</font>
<br>Five-foot-ten, about a buck twenty
<br>Skinny as a rod but still won't fuck with me
<br>Wise ass n-gga, you'd think I was 50
<br>But I take your 50 after you take this spliff, see?

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Chorus]</font>
<br><font color="#bbd8a4">Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know</font>

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Breakdown]</font>
<br>Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
<br>Step to me and you will be handled
<br>See, that's my crown on the mantle
<br>And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be scandal
<br>Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
<br>Step to me and you will be handled
<br>See, that's my crown on the mantle
<br>And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be scandal

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Verse 5]</font>
<br>This is the end, but you really feeling it
<br>Here's one more verse, cause I ain’t no stingy bitch
<br>Ain't got much to say cause it's in my piece
<br>Guess my words are blunt and I ain't talking weed

<br><br><font color="#695794">[Chorus]</font>
<br><font color="#bbd8a4">Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>Yep, yep, you know that I go
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
<br>This is me on the regular, so you know
