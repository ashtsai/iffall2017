<em>But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?<br>
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?<br>
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to<br>
<div class="letter-spacing"><div class="positive">Baby, I'm yours now</div></div>
Dreaming a connection<br>
I can meet you downtown<br>
I'll take you where you wanna be <div class="letter-spacing"><div class="positive">tonight</div></div></em><br>


Too much looking around<br>
I can see how this happens<br>
Using up all the lifelines<br>
Tryna turn out decent<br>
You've got plenty of time<br>
I can see you walked over<br>
What you see isn't in my mind<br>
Don't believe we've met before<br>
I'm acting, playing quiet, smiling, without thought<br>
'Cause my world's been turned inside out<br>
Been gone quite a while<br><br>

Aren't you gonna stay?<br>
Keep me 'til the sun comes up<br>
Crack a Pellegrino<br>
From the bottle, no cup<br>
That was summer love, that was summer love<br>
Late night, cemetery<br>
Think it's still light out<br>
Temporary love at sight now<br>
Love is scary, baby, look out<br><br>
