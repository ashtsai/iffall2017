<body>
<li>try a different color for each postcard so it doesn't all look exactly the same </li>
<li>use a different typeface that better conveys the drama and glamour of drag queens</li>
<li>Sasha Velour's hand is cropped out of the third postcard - find a photo that includes her whole hand?</li>
<li>keep text content consistent throughout desktop to mobile changes (don't add extra ellipses and quotation marks)</li>
<li>sometimes the text comes too close to the figure</li>
