		<b>OVERVIEW</b>
		<br><br>
		Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are "augmented" by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, haptics or GPS data. 

		<br><br>It is related to a more general concept called computer-mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. 

		<br><br>Augmented reality enhances one's current perception of reality, whereas in contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.  Augmented reality is used in order to enhance the experienced environments or situations and to offer enriched experiences. </div>
