<br><br><br>i feel creepy all the time 
<br>'cause i like everybody more than they like me 
<br>i know ur feelings and i make them rhyme 

<br><br>it's getting darker every day 
<br>and everyone is pushing me out of the sun's way 
<br>i just wanna see the light 

<br><br>what do u think of leaving Earth and everyone we know 
<br>we can go anytime u want just let me know 

<br><br>i just wanna be a firefly 
<br>i just want the human race to die 
<br>already 

<br><br>we're only worth what we give back 
<br>and i deserve a heart attack 

<br><br>what do u think of leaving Earth and everyone we know 
<br>we could go anytime u want just let me know 

<br><br>i just wanna be a firefly 
<br>i just want the human race to die 

<br><br>what do u think of leaving Earth and everyone we know 
<br>we could go anytime u want just let me know 

<br><br>i don't wanna be a firefly 
<br>and i don't want u to die
